## Additional Advanced Requirements: Cinema Application

### User Authentication and Authorization

1. Implement JWT authentication:
    - Access tokens should have a lifespan of no more than 5 minutes.
    - Refresh tokens should have a lifespan of no more than 1 hour.

2. Implement user registration functionality:
    - Users should be able to register using an email and password.
    - Implement an email verification step during registration. Users should be sent a verification link via email, which they have to click to activate their account.

3. Implement role-based authorization:
    - Regular users should only have permission to read data.
    - Staff users should have permission to perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Advanced Functionality

4. Implement a rating system:
    - Authenticated users should be able to rate movies.
    - The system should calculate and display the average rating for each movie.

5. Pagination and Sorting:
    - Implement pagination for the movie list. Users should be able to control the number of items per page.
    - Allow users to sort the movie list by different parameters (e.g., title, release date, rating).

6. Search Functionality:
    - Implement a search feature that allows users to search for movies by title, director, or genre.

7. Implement movie recommendation functionality:
    - Based on the user's watch history and ratings, the system should recommend similar movies.

8. Implement Docker health checks for all the services in the Docker Compose configuration.

9. Integrate a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. You can use platforms like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.

10. Write automated tests for all the critical functionality of the application.
